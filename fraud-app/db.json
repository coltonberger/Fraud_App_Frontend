    "description": "About the workshop:In one afternoon, you'll learn how to make interactive, sound-responsive video using a totally free visual programming environment called Pure Data.Pure Data, also known as Pd, is an open source graphical programming environment. It is frequently used by artists and musicians to create custom digital sythesizers, images that respond to sound and other inputs, or to interface with hardware such as Arduino and midi keyboards.The big difference between Pd and other programming languages: this tool uses an interface that relies on visually connecting onscreen elements, as opposed to writing out code.Do I need any prior experience?Nope! We're expecting that this is the first time you'll be using PureData. You're going to be surprised how far we can get you in a single afternoon.What should I bring?Bring your laptop, with PureData downloaded and installed. PureData is an open-source software, which means it's absolutely free! You can get it here: http://puredata.info/downloadsPd runs on Mac, PC, Linux and some other operating systems we've never heard of.The instructor will be teaching on a Mac.About the instructor:Dafydd Hughes is a musician, an artist, and programmer and an educator based in Toronto. He has performed and recorded with some of Canada’s most notable artists, including Feist, Esthero and Jacksoul. His work, both musical and visual, playfully explores the unpredictable intersection of analog and digital experiences of the world.In addition to sitting on the Board of Directors at InterAccess Electronic Media Arts Centre, Dafydd is an instructor at Ryerson University, OCAD University and Sheridan College.",

    "description": "Healthcare Conference and Pitch EventDate: Tuesday 28 MayTime: 7:00 pm (ends by 10:00 pm)Location: BDO (Baker Street / Marble Arch tube stations)Topic:taking advantage of the changing landscape of the European healthcare sector.The event will consist of the following:- an expert panel of investors and entrepreneurs- pitches by four early stage companies (with Q&A)- an opportunity to network with other entrepreneurs and investors in the healthcare spaceHealthcare is one of the largest sectors of the UK economy and one of the most dynamic due to considerable research investment and the on-going NHS restructuring. There was more R&D performed in the pharmaceutical sector than any other, with expenditure in 2010 at £4.6 billion, representing 29% of all UK R&D spending. However, It is estimated that only 30-70% of patients respond positively to any particular drug. Even the best medicines are not equally effective in all patients. Recent advances in science, particularly in molecular biology and genomics, mean that it is sometimes possible to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease (in particular their genetic causes) in patients. The Stratified Medicine (Personalized Medicine) Innovation Platform seeks to build on the UK’s strength within the global healthcare industries and put it at the centre of the next generation of medicine. In December 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron said that the government's National Health Service (NHS) has earmarked £100 million, or about $160 million, to the effort. The money is part of a £600 million government healthcare investment announced for research in the coming years. The sequencing is expected to take 3 to 5 years.Panelists:- Dr Stephen Parker, Venture Capitalist, Celtic Pharma Holdings- Thibaut De Cours (WG 2003), Healthcare entrepreneur- Yelda Kaya (CBS 2008), Business Development, GlaxoSmithKlineModerator: Dr Vernon Harten-Ash (WG 1994), healthcare entrepreneurSelected Startups: TBA (applications still open, see below)Schedule: 45min expert panel followed by 1 hour startup pitch session and a networking cocktail (provided).Organisation:This event has been organised by the Wharton Entrepreneur Group, the Wharton Healthcare networks and the Columbia Business Angels Network in London.Volunteers: Vernon Harten-Ash (WG 1994), Thibaut De Cours (WG 2003), Matt Kingswood (WG 2003), Emmanuel Léonard (CU 2007). .About the Columbia Angel & Entrepreneurs NetworkStarted in 2012, the \"Columbia Alumni Angels & Entrepreneurs Network in London\" is a group of alumni interested in entrepreneurship and early-stage investing in private companies on an individual basis.

    "description": "Tried online programming courses, but never seem to finish? Now's your chance to get stuck into programming, but with the help of your peers and an instructor.We'll be meeting to discuss and overcome the challenges we encounter in the Udacity \"Introduction to Computer Science\" online course (http://bit.ly/udacs101) be they homework, in class-exercises, or key concepts. These study groups will be led by an experienced programmer who will assist with our difficulties. The study-groups will be highly practical, and focused on programming - not on being lectured.At home, you'll be completing one unit per week (about 2-3 hours). This will be a collection of video lectures, and programming exercises that you'll complete by yourself, in your web-browser on the Udacity website. Then, we'll have our weekly instructor sessions where you'll reinforce what you've learnt online. Instructor sessions will then last one to two hours.We’ll meet seven times, beginning on the week of the 15th April, until the week of the 31st of May.The cost of attending the seven instructor-led study groups is £70.“At the end of this course you will have a rock solid foundation for programming in Python and built a working web crawler.” For more information on course structure and syllabus: http://bit.ly/udacs101.If this is something you're excited about doing, email mdetmold@gmail.com.See you soon,Michael",

Uday believes that when immersed in the note and raga, the self disappears and music takes on its own existence; the principle of ‘darshan’. These values are helping him on the path of devotion to Dhrupad.Dhrupad is one of the oldest forms of North Indian classical music and Uday maintains its majesty and subtle nuances. Dhrupad is a living and evolving classical music tradition. Uday has developed a unique style deeply embedded in raga ras and bhaav.Dhrupad is one of the oldest forms of North Indian classical music and Uday maintains its majesty and subtle nuances. Dhrupad is a living and evolving classical music tradition. Uday has developed a unique style deeply embedded in raga ras and bhaav. This brings a creative melodic addition to the precise intonation and pronunciation characteristic to the Dhrupad style. Uday spent over 12 years studying and living in the traditional guru-shishya parampara with Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar (Vocal) and Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar (Rudra-Veena), the towering pillars of the Dhrupad tradition. During this period there was a simple and complete concentration on the music itself. This intimate relationship, in which the Ustads willingly gave their inner secrets along with Uday’s devotion, brought him to a deep sense of completeness and wholeness.Read more about Pt.

These varieties range from the better-known Syrah and Viognier to the up-and-coming Mourvèdre, Grenache and Roussanne, to obscure (but delicious) grapes like Counoise and Picpoul.The Rhone Rangers started from a small gathering of American vintners who began meeting informally in the 1980s. As their numbers expanded, the group organized under the name “Rhone Rangers.” The Rhone Rangers is a non-profit organization focused on promoting the enjoyment of Rhone varietal wines produced in the United States. These grapes include the 22 traditional varieties approved by the French government for the Côtes du Rhone, as well as Durif (Petite Sirah). In order for a winery to join the Rhone Rangers, they must produce at least one wine that contains 75% of any single approved varietal (or combination of these varietals).",

    "description": "Is it OK to accept a coffee from service provider? If one of your service providers offered to wine and dine you at the footy or the theatre – would you accept? What if they said they were going to invite you but decided to give you $125 instead, would you take the money? Is there a difference?Do you accept Christmas gifts from service providers? A bottle or two of wine perhaps? What about a $100 gift card?If you found you had made a mistake on a project thatmighthave safety implications, butwillcost your company money to rectify - do you own up?This not to be missed session, facilitated byHis Honour Judge Ronald Solomon of the NSW District Court.CIBSE, Engineers Australia and most other professional institutions have rules covering ethical behaviour – not least because the very term ‘professional’ is supposed to stand for something. Are you ‘professional’?In this thought provoking session we will explore a number of ethical issues. To help us through the maze we are delighted to have the input of His Honour Judge Ronald Solomon of the NSW District Court who will cover some broad ethics issues before we go into Q&A mode.",

    "description": "Teaching Self Governing is the foundational class for parents who want to be truly effective parents. This class is designed to help parents know how to best help their children grow up to be responsible, self governed individuals. This is a must attend class for parents with children of all ages!Price listed is for 2 people (husband and wife).If you understand how to do this together, you will be much more effective parents.Nicholeen and Spencer Peck were on the UK Television Show called \"The World's Strictest Parents\". They were so successful that they are now in high demand to speak all over the world. The Peck's are parents of four and previous foster parents of many.  They have been trained and certified in using the “Teaching Family Model”, which was developed at Boys Town and is used by the Utah Youth Village.  The Pecks did foster care for very difficult teens.  They taught children with ADHD, OCD, kleptomania, compulsive lying, anger control issues, etc.  Nicholeen said, “I taught behaviors, not medication.  They would come to us on many medications and usually leave not on any medications.  Many children are misdiagnosed.  They just need to learn cause and effect better.”Nicholeen has been teaching self government skills to people all over the world for 11 years and has published a book on this subject called \"Parenting A House United.\"  They have a new Implementation Program that Nicholeen calls, \"...the greatest thing we have to offer families yet!\"",
