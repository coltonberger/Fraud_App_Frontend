## Fraud Detection Case Study

## Description
For the next two days we will work with the entire end to end pipeline of data science through a case study. We have touched on aspects of this throughout the course but have not yet put all the pieces together.

Topics included in this case study include:
Day 1: Project scoping, Team direction, Model building
Day 2: Web app and deployment

## Deliverables
Web Development: A dashboard for investigators to use which helps them identify new events that are worthy of investigation for fraud. This will pull in new data regularly, and update a useful display for the investigation team. How you wish to lay this out is up to you.

Data Science :Building your model, notes on how to get started with the dataset and how to save your model once you've trained it.
